- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participant has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
  activities/procedures.'
- "* Age \u2265 18 years (or \u2265 legal age within the country if it is older than\
  \ 18 years) at the time of signing the informed consent."
- '* Participant must have histological, pathological, and/or cytological confirmation
  of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.'
- "* mCRPC with \u2265 1 metastatic lesion that is present on baseline computed tomography\
  \ (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scan imaging obtained within 28\
  \ days prior to enrollment."
- '* Evidence of progressive disease, defined as 1 or more PCWG3 criteria:'
- '* Serum PSA progression defined as 2 consecutive increases in PSA over a previous
  reference value measured at least 1 week prior. The minimal start value is 2.0 ng/mL.'
- "* Soft-tissue progression defined as an increase \u2265 20% in the sum of the diameter\
  \ (SOD) (short axis for nodal lesions and long axis for non-nodal lesions) of all\
  \ target lesions based on the smallest SOD since treatment started or the appearance\
  \ of one or more new lesions."
- '* Progression of bone disease: evaluable disease or new bone lesion(s) by bone
  scan (2+2 PCWG3 criteria, Scher et al, 2016).'
- '* Participants must have had a prior orchiectomy and/or ongoing androgen-deprivation
  therapy and a castrate level of serum testosterone (\< 50 ng/dL or \< 1.7 nmol/L).'
- '* Prior treatment with at least one ARDT.'
- '* Prior treatment with one taxane therapy. Prior treatment with docetaxel in the
  hormone-sensitive setting is permitted. Participants who received two or more prior
  chemotherapy regimens in the castrate-resistant setting are not eligible.'
- '* Prior treatment with radioligand therapy (RLT), radionuclide therapy (Radium-223),
  poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, or immune checkpoint inhibitor is permitted.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Prior \& Concomitant Therapy:'
- Exclude - * Prior six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1)-targeted
  therapy.
- Exclude - * Any anticancer therapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agent within
  4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, not including androgen suppression
  therapy.
- Exclude - * Prior Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy
  (RLT) within 2 months of the first dose of study treatment unless participants received
  \< 2 cycles of therapy. Participants who received 1 cycle of PSMA RLT within 35
  days prior to the first dose of study treatment are also excluded.
- Exclude - * Participants who started a bisphosphonate or denosumab regimen within
  4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment
  (or local or focal radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study
  treatment).
- Exclude - * Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radioligand therapy,
  PARP inhibitor, biological therapy, or investigational therapy.
- 'Exclude - Disease Related:'
- Exclude - * Participants with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.
- Exclude - * Unresolved toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy with CTCAE version
  5.0 events grade above 1 or baseline, with the exception of alopecia or toxicities
  that are stable and well controlled AND there is an agreement to allow inclusion
  by both the investigator and the sponsor.
